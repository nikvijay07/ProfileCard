                <p> I have a strong passion for collaborating with peers. I swam competitively before college 
                    and offered swim lessons to those in need. I'm also an 
                    Eagle scout and served as a troop guide, assisting younger scouts. </p>

                        in class. Many of them do not have the full resources to receive other educational support, so I try to help 
                        them out. </p>
